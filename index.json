In comparison with the 2009 pandemic (pH1N1), SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely to lead to more severe disease, with multi-organ effects, including cardiovascular disease. SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with acute and long-term cardiovascular disease, but the molecular changes that govern this remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the host transcriptome landscape of cardiac tissues collected at rapid autopsy from seven SARS-CoV-2, two pH1N1, and six control patients using targeted spatial transcriptomics approaches. Although SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in cardiac tissue, host transcriptomics showed upregulation of genes associated with DNA damage and repair, heat shock, and M1-like macrophage infiltration in the cardiac tissues of COVID-19 patients. The DNA damage present in the SARS-CoV-2 patient samples, were further confirmed by γ-H2Ax immunohistochemistry. In comparison, pH1N1 showed upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes, in particular interferon and complement pathways, when compared with COVID-19 patients. These data demonstrate the emergence of distinct transcriptomic profiles in cardiac tissues of SARS-CoV-2 and pH1N1 influenza infection supporting the need for a greater understanding of the effects on extra-pulmonary organs, including the cardiovascular system of COVID-19 patients, to delineate the immunopathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and long term impact on health.","tags":["spatial transcriptomics","COVID","gene-set enrichment analysis"],"title":"Transcriptomic profiling of cardiac tissues from SARS-CoV-2 patients identifies DNA damage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arutha Kulasinghe","Chin Wee Tan","Anna Flavia Ribeiro dos Santos Miggiolaro","James Monkman","Habib SadeghiRad","Dharmesh D Bhuva","Jarbas da Silva Motta Junior","Caroline Busatta Vaz de Paula","Seigo Nagashima","Cristina Pellegrino Baena","Paulo Souza-Fonseca-Guimaraes","Lucia de Noronha","Timothy McCulloch","Gustavo Rodrigues Rossi","Caroline Cooper","Benjamin Tang","Kirsty R Short","Melissa J Davis","Fernando Souza-Fonseca-Guimaraes","Gabrielle T Belz","Ken O'Byrne"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1654128e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654128e3,"objectID":"a9c47e21979db3c45655542a2d50aa13","permalink":"https://bhuvad.github.io/publication/2022_kulasinghe_covidlung/","publishdate":"2022-06-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_kulasinghe_covidlung/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which emerged in late 2019 has spread globally, causing a pandemic of respiratory illness designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A better definition of the pulmonary host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is required to understand viral pathogenesis and to validate putative COVID-19 biomarkers that have been proposed in clinical studies.\nMethods: Here, we use targeted transcriptomics of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue using the NanoString GeoMX platform to generate an in-depth picture of the pulmonary transcriptional landscape of COVID-19, pandemic H1N1 influenza and uninfected control patients.\nResults: Host transcriptomics showed a significant upregulation of genes associated with inflammation, type I interferon production, coagulation and angiogenesis in the lungs of COVID-19 patients compared to non-infected controls. SARS-CoV-2 was non-uniformly distributed in lungs (emphasising the advantages of spatial transcriptomics) with the areas of high viral load associated with an increased type I interferon response. Once the dominant cell type present in the sample, within patient correlations and patient–patient variation, had been controlled for, only a very limited number of genes were differentially expressed between the lungs of fatal influenza and COVID-19 patients. Strikingly, the interferon-associated gene IFI27, previously identified as a useful blood biomarker to differentiate bacterial and viral lung infections, was significantly upregulated in the lungs of COVID-19 patients compared to patients with influenza.\nConclusion: Collectively, these data demonstrate that spatial transcriptomics is a powerful tool to identify novel gene signatures within tissues, offering new insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-COV-2 to aid in patient triage and treatment.","tags":["spatial transcriptomics","COVID","gene-set enrichment analysis"],"title":"Profiling of lung SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infection dissects virus-specific host responses and gene signatures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jean Berthelet","Momeneh Foroutan","Dharmesh D Bhuva","Holly J Whitfield","Farrah El-Saafin","Joseph Cursons","Antonin Serrano","Michal Merdas","Elgene Lim","Emmanuelle Charafe-Jauffret","Christophe Ginestier","Matthias Ernst","Frédéric Hollande","Robin L Anderson","Bhupinder Pal","Belinda Yeo","Melissa J Davis","Delphine Merino"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1652313600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652313600,"objectID":"f91d39d3afe8b79715f6cbe984fd7a0f","permalink":"https://bhuvad.github.io/publication/2022_berthelet_drugpred/","publishdate":"2022-05-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_berthelet_drugpred/","section":"publication","summary":"In this work, we developed models to predict drug response in cancer patients using cell line models","tags":["pharmacogenomics","molecular phenotypes","drug reponse prediction","breast cancer"],"title":"Computational Screening of Anti-Cancer Drugs Identifies a New BRCA Independent Gene Expression Signature to Predict Breast Cancer Sensitivity to Cisplatin","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dharmesh D Bhuva","Chin Wee Tan","Ning Liu","Holly J Whitfield","Nicholas Papachristos","Sam Lee","Malvika Kharbanda","Ahmed Mohamed","Melissa J Davis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1646611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646611200,"objectID":"68933faacb7083f0dbca0ed13f2e90d3","permalink":"https://bhuvad.github.io/publication/2022_bhuva_visse/","publishdate":"2022-03-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_bhuva_visse/","section":"publication","summary":"vissE is a tool that can help identify, visualise and explore higher-order biological processes from the results of a gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA)","tags":["gene-set enrichment analysis","molecular phenotypes","networks","breast cancer","EMT"],"title":"vissE: A versatile tool to identify and visualise higher-order molecular phenotypes from functional enrichment analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laura Genovesi","Amanda Millar","Elissa Tolson","Matthew Singleton","Emily Hassall","Marija Kojic","Caterina Brighi","Emily Girard","Clara Andradas","Mani Kuchibhotla","Dharmesh D Bhuva","Raelene Endersby","Nicholas G Gottardo","Anne Bernard","Christelle Adolphe","James M Olson","Melissa J Davis","Brandon J Wainwright"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1624233600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624233600,"objectID":"f7b95926a7f351484fe73457c8799f29","permalink":"https://bhuvad.github.io/publication/2021_genovesi_mb/","publishdate":"2021-06-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021_genovesi_mb/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant paediatric brain tumour and a leading cause of cancer-related mortality and morbidity. Existing treatment protocols are aggressive in nature resulting in significant neurological, intellectual and physical disabilities for the children undergoing treatment. Thus, there is an urgent need for improved, targeted therapies that minimize these harmful side effects.\nMethods: We identified candidate drugs for MB using a network-based systems-pharmacogenomics approach: based on results from a functional genomics screen, we identified a network of interactions implicated in human MB growth regulation. We then integrated drugs and their known mechanisms of action, along with gene expression data from a large collection of medulloblastoma patients to identify drugs with potential to treat MB.\nResults: Our analyses identified drugs targeting CDK4, CDK6 and AURKA as strong candidates for MB; all of these genes are well validated as drug targets in other tumour types. We also identified non-WNT MB as a novel indication for drugs targeting TUBB, CAD, SNRPA, SLC1A5, PTPRS, P4HB and CHEK2. Based upon these analyses, we subsequently demonstrated that one of these drugs, the new microtubule stabilizing agent, ixabepilone, blocked tumour growth in vivo in mice bearing patient-derived xenograft tumours of the Sonic Hedgehog and Group 3 subtype, providing the first demonstration of its efficacy in MB.\nConclusions: Our findings confirm that this data-driven systems pharmacogenomics strategy is a powerful approach for the discovery and validation of novel therapeutic candidates relevant to MB treatment, and along with data validating ixabepilone in PDX models of the two most aggressive subtypes of medulloblastoma, we present the network analysis framework as a resource for the field.","tags":["pharmacogenomics","networks","brain cancer"],"title":"Systems pharmacogenomics identifies novel targets and clinically actionable therapeutics for medulloblastoma","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dharmesh D Bhuva","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
