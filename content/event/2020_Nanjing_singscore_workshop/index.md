title: Single-Sample Gene-Set Testing of TCGA RNA-Seq Data Workshop

event: 'WEHI - Nanjing University Online Bioinformatics Workshops 2020'
event_url: ''

location: Online (Nanjing University, China)

summary: This workshop demonstrates a workflow for single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis.
abstract: 'In this workshop, you will be learning how to perform a single sample gene set analysis of transcriptomic data from cancer patients. You will learn how to programmatically access and process the rich transcriptomic data provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). These data will then be used to perform a single-sample, patient-specific gene set analysis using the tools and visualisations in the singscore R/Bioconductor package. You will learn how to plot and interpret diagnostic plots and results from a single-sample gene set analysis. This workshop is aimed at biologists interested in learning how to perform single-sample gene set analysis of transcriptomic data. The material we will be covering is available at https://f1000research.com/articles/8-776. A Chinese translation of this workshop can be found at https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/workflows/vignettes/SingscoreAMLMutations/inst/doc/workflow_transcriptional_mut_sig_chinese.html.'
