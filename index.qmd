I am an early career computational biology researcher (PhD in 2020) in the Davis laboratory at SAiGENCI. I have developed high quality bioinformatics software and methods that enable exploration of molecular phenotypes in cancer systems. I am currently working on developing statistical and computational methods to analyse high throughput spatial transcriptomics datasets.
